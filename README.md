# QFC Reproducible Research Workshop

This repository contains presentations, examples and all of the
source code associated with a workshop I was asked to give at the
Quantitative Fisheries Center at Michigan
State University.  The workshop was held on December 11-12, 2013.

The intent of the workshop was to introduce participants to open
source tools that can be used to perform their analysis in a
completely transparent and reproducible manner.  The work shop
included a number of introductory lectures and worked examples that
can be adapted to the participants real work analysis needs.

Software requirements for the workshop included
[Latex](http://www.latex-project.org/),
[R](http://www.r-project.org/), [AD Model](http://admb-project.org/)
builder, and [git](http://git-scm.com/).  A development environment
was configured in emacs that provided a single user interface and a
number of convienience functions.  The use of emacs was only recommended
and was not a requirement for the workshop.


## Topics

Topics covered in the workshop included brief introductions to the
basic concepts of reproducible research, emacs, latex, sweave/knitr,
how to transfer data between AD Model builder and R, and version
control using git.  The topics were not covered in exhaustive detail
but were covered sufficiently to provide participants with enough
information to actually use the tools in their day-to-day work.
Numerous examples where provided to demonstrate concepts introduced in
each of the presentations.
