* About this file
- this file contains a working list of examples that will be used
  during the QFC reproducible research workshop scheduled for December
  11-12, 2013.
- each bullet point will be associated with an example
- each example will be located in an individual directory
- comments below each point contain a mixture of teaching points,
  speaking points and things to include in the example (this will be
  straightend out as the examples develop)
- in addition to required files, each directory should contain a
  readme.org file that explains the examples in more detail


* Basic Latex Example
** Teaching Points
- this example will include a simple report entirely in latex format
- review contents of tex file
- sections/document structure
- demontrate how to complile it from the command line and from emacs
- discuss what is happening

** Readme.org
- instructions

* Basic Sweave Example

- move to rnw file (no longer edit tex file)
- dynamic content generated by knitr/sweave
- chunks and \Sexpr{}
- extra step in compilation process
- sweave/knitr produce tex file
- compiled as before

** Teaching Points
** Readme.org


* Sweave Example

- reading dat from csv
- chunk options
- strategies for tables and figures
- formatting string for \Sexpr{}
** Teaching Points
** Readme.org




* Sweave References and Abstract
** Teaching Points
** Readme.org

- references and abstracts are integral part of scientific writing
- bibtex works with latex to automatically compile and format
  references in report
- bib file - text 'database' of references
- bst 'bilbliography style' file - cjfas has been provided
- \ref{}
- abstracts appear at begining of any report, but require information
  that isn't available until later - write abstract at the end of the
  rnw file and use \include{} to insert it into correct location of
  the document


* Multi-part Sweave Document
** Teaching Points
** Readme.org

- possible to write and compile large complex documents such as
  reports, books and dissertations
- used one main.rnw file for overall organization and settings
- use a sweave() and \include{} for each additional section
- this example will build on earlier examples by having chapters for
  lake whitefish, lake trout, and yellow perch

* Presentations and Beamer
** Teaching Points
** Readme.org

- latex/sweave not just for reports
- this example will illustrate how to create a simple presentation in
  beamer using sweave


* BONUS - Sweave example with rodbc connection
** Teaching Points
** Readme.org



* ADMB - Getting data to and from R
** Teaching Points
** Readme.org

- examples include methods of getting data from ADMB to R
- parse rep file
- write files for specific elements
- admb2R
  + cxx format and syntax basics
- ADMButils
  + read and write pin, par and dat files
  + readcxx() 

* Example ADMB Report
- redo earlier example, but fit with admb
- extra steps - compile and run admb before running report
- much more powerful optimization

** Teaching Points
** Readme.org



* BONUS - More Advanced Example ADMB Report
- connect to db
- query data
- write dat and pin file
- call admb
- read std, par and rdat
- create tex and compile to pdf

** Teaching Points
** Readme.org




* Intro to Git

** Teaching Points
** Readme.org


- Git commit basics
- Git branching/merging
- Git Remote
  + push, pull, clone
- Git Hooks
  + info.gin 
  + post_commit and post_checkout??



* Integrating Git-Sweave-ADMB
- provide an actual scaa model and pdf report
- demonstrate how to reset head to commit used to generate report
- recreate report and view source files
- reset directory to current working head
- revisit source files
