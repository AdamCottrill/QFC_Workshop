* Reproducible Research Workshop examples

ADD timestamp footer to sweave reports


** DONE minimal_latex
- this directory contains a minimal working latex document
- verify that latex works and can compile a document to pdf.
- from command line: pdflatex min.tex
- in emacs: C-c C-c <enter>
- <F10> (ac-view-pdf) to view resultant pdf

** DONE basic_latex
- this report contains the basic elements of a scientific paper.
- it contains all of the basic sections (abstract, introduction,
  materials and methods ect), a figure, some tables, and references.
- there are also calculated or estimated values referenced in the text
- the document itself is fine, it should compile into a 5-page
  document, but it is not dynamic - infact given the markup required
  to print latex it's worse than cutting an pasting from excel into word.

** DONE basic_sweave
- this example takes the basic latex report and makes it dynamic
- all of the presented values are calculated, figures and tables are
  generated from the data file
- introduces concepts of chunks and \Sexpr{}

** TODO sweave_chunk_options
- this example is a bit of an aside and will demonstrate the effects
  of some different chunk options.
- include, figure, asis, etc

** DONE Abstracts
- abstracts present special challenges because they are at the
  beginning of the document but need final results
- introduce \include{} statement and chunk option to produce abstract.
- a worked example can be found here: [[file:~/Misc/OrgFiles/JOURNAL.org::*Sweaving%20an%20Abstract][Sweaving an Abstract]]

*** DONE References
- don't spend a huge amount of time on this, but demonstrate that it
  can be done.
- need to activate reftex in .emacs
- introduce Bibtex, reftex and natbib
- replace static reference section with dynamic one
- add more references and recreate document. 


** DONE ReferenceAbstracts
- references and abstracts present special challenges

** DONE dynamic sweave
- given our basic sweave report, now lets make it more dynamic by
  specifying year and basin were fitting
- provide a data directory with data from three different basins and
  two years
- demonstrate how the report changes when different data is used.


** more_sweave
- more sweave concepts
- illustrate chunk options
- different ways to insert figures


** MultiPartSweave
- Multi part documents are easy to produce
- one main rnw file
  + document wide settings (toc, references ect)
  + knitr() and \include{} for each section
- create simple report with chapters fro whitefish, lake trout and
  perch. One introduction, one conclusion, and common references.


** Presentations
- presentations can be easily created using the beamer package
- create a quick presentation showing the basic information of the
  report:
  + title slide
  + slide with introductory text (\Sexpr{})
  + length histogram
  + fitted curve
  + summary table(s)


** Sweave_ODBC
- include an example of retrieving data from sqlite db instead of ms access.
- use same sweave report, just replace read.csv with rodbc connect

** DONE admb_r
- demonstrate ways to get data back and forth between admb and R
- no knitr
- script that writes admb dat and pin files
- reads par, std and makes values available in R


** DONE admb_sweave
- take the last von bert report
- move curve fitting out to admb
- read data in R
- write data and pin files
- call admb
- read_cxx() to get model estimates
- present model estimates from cxx using knitr


** adv_admb_report
- real scaa example (AA_89)


** git


** extract_data
- this isn't really an example - just the script I used to select
  data from our databases.
