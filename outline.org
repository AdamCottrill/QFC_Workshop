* R, Sweave, ADMB and Reproducible Research in Fisheries Science

** Workshop Objectives

- introduce concept of reproducible research
- introduce software tools and methods of work that are consistent
  with reproducible research
- provide you with an understanding of what each tool is doing and
  how they fit together
- provide worked examples that you can adapt to you own analysis


** Workshop Approach
- incrementally introduce tools and basic usage
- presentations and discussions followed by exercises
- applied - lots of examples
- most examples incrementally build on earlier examples
- some bonus examples that people might want to explore

   
** Software requirements
+ assumed these applications are installed and properly configured on
  your computer:
+ working knowledge of 
  - AD Model Builder 
  - R
+ installed:
  + Latex
  + sweave/knittr
  + git 
+ Integrated Development Environment:
  + emacs with admb-ide, ESS, magit (see workshop configuration)
OR
  + Rstudio, and admb-ide, git-gui 


** Workshop Outline

  + more complicated reports:
    + multiple tables
    + multiple figures
    + references
    + abstract
    + presentation
    + multiple chapters
- AMDB and Sweave
  + communicating between ADMB and R
  + admb2R
  + ADMButils
  + reports using model fit with admb
- Version Control
  + basic concepts
  + intro to git
  + example using git and a scaa
  + Integrating git with sweave





*** Reproducible Research
- what is reproducible research
- how it is changing science - gold standard for open, transparent
  and credible science
- MORE ...



*** Typical Work Flow
- separate files for each stage of process:
  + data cleaning and preparation
  + model fitting and analysis
  + summarization and reporting
- lots of clicking and copy-paste
- often uses proprietary binary file format (.ppt, .doc, .xls) that
  is difficult to 'version'
- tedious, error prone, difficult or impossible to replicate exactly

*** But what if ...
- I make a small change to data?
- I want to implement complicated model improvements that might break everything?
- I need to find data and model that created a report
- I need to work collaborative with an other analyst?
    + How do I know exactly what's changed
    + How do I integrate their changes with my changes?


*** Alternative Workflow

- all preparation, analysis, reporting done in simple text files
- results from analysis integrated directly into reporting products -
  reports, presentations, html documents
- no undocumented clicking or cutting and pasting 
- version control software keeps track of changes
  + reset directory to past states
  + compare changes from one state to another
  + branching and merging allow 'safe' development






*** what is sweave?

sweave/knittR

**** Some simple examples
- A super simple template fits a linear model and produces a simple
  tpl report

**** Some more challenging examples
- report fitting VonB curve - with plots, summary tables, embedded
  results(Sexpr{}) and an abstract
- include figure directory

*** Connecting admb and R
- cover options to get output to and from admb to R
- writing text file
- ADBM2R package - Mike Prager et at
- R2ADMB package - 
- glmmADMB - 
 
*** Using ADMB2R
- cxx file format
- modification to tpl
- placement of admb2r.cpp file

*** admbUtils
- R-functions for reading and writing files associated with admb
- reads par, std files
- writes dat and pin files
- readcxx() wrapper that returns object containing values in par, std,
  and .rdat
- read.mcmc() - general function to read in mcmc results produced by
  admb (takes a number of arguments to accommodate numerous formats)

*** ADMButils Examples
- write pin and dat files from R
- fit model
- read model output

*** ADMB, R and Sweave
- now work through some examples of fitting models in ADMB and
  producing report(s)
- start simple - VonB example above
- extend to a scaa model

*** Directory Setup
- ModelDir
    - sweave
    - sweave_long
    - figures
    - .git


    
*** intro to git

    
*** resources
- py video
- software carpentry
- paper on bioinformatics project organization
- paper on reproducablity and openness
- git
- sweave
- knitter
