* Motivation

** Practical

** Philosophical


* Reproducible Research
- what is reproducible research
- how it is changing science - gold standard for open, transparent
  and credible science
- MORE ...

* Typical Work Flow

- separate files for each stage of process:
  + data cleaning and preparation
  + model fitting and analysis
  + summarization and reporting
- lots of clicking and copy-paste
- often uses proprietary binary file format (.ppt, .doc, .xls) that
  is difficult to 'version'
- tedious, error prone, difficult or impossible to replicate exactly

* But what if ...
- I make a small change to data?
- I have multiple reports?
- I want to implement complicated model improvements that might break everything?
- I need to find data and exact model or source code that created a report
- I need to work collaborative with an other analyst?
    + How do I know *exactly* what's changed?
    + How do I integrate their changes with my changes?


* Reproducible Research

- provides an alternative method of work that avoids many of these problems
- Literate Programing
- Donald Knuth
- more recently...

* An Alternative Work-flow

- all preparation, analysis, reporting done in simple text files
- results from analysis integrated directly into reporting products -
  reports, presentations, html documents
- reports automatically regenerated when data changes
- no undocumented figures, tables or results

* An Alternative Work-flow (cont'd)

- no undocumented clicking or cutting and pasting 
- version control software keeps track of changes
  + reset directory to past states
  + compare changes from one state to another
  + branching and merging allow 'safe' development
