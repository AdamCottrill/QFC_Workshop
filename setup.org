** Installed Software
- these set up instructions assume that you have working
  installations of the following software packages:
+ R  ()
+ ADMB  ()  
+ Miktex (Latex) () and 
+ git

** Set up
- a zip file will be provided that will contain all of the
  configurations files and additional packages needed for the workshop
- unzip the contents of the archive to a convenient location and note
  the path

** What's in the zip?
- emacs executable
- aspell executable - spell checker for e-macs
- emacs plugins:
  + autocomplete
  + admb-ide
  + ESS - emacs speaks statistics
  + magit 
  + yasnippet
- associated utility files

** Set up - emacs
- navigate to ~/workshop directory
- double click emacs.bat to start emacs (ignore warnings for now)
- from within emacs open the .emacs file located in the ~\workshop directory
- edit line 5 of .emacs to reflect location of the
  "~/workshop/emacs/" directory on your computer
- save the .emacs file and close emacs
- re-open emacs by double clicking on emacs.bat - the warning should
  be gone

** Set up - R-packages

- make sure that the following packages have been installed into your
  instance of R
  + knitr (and/or sweave) - both available on CRAN
  + ADMButils (see ~/utils/Rpackages)


** Set up - ADMB

- edit paths in ~/workshop/emacs/SetADMBpaths.bat to reflect location
  of your admb installation and path to your compiler
- copy ~/workshop/utils/admb2r.cpp to ADMB_HOME/include/admb2r.cpp


** Tests
- the first series of tests will be conducted independent of emacs
- later tests will verify that emacs is configured properly and all
  of your plugins are working
- each of following slides assume that you have a command prompt
  open.  
  + The top line indicates what you need to type, 
  + the body of the slide indicates what you should see if you were
    successful (a ... indicates that the output has been trimmed)
  + if a bottom line is present on the slide, it will indicate the
    command needed to return to prompt
- if the command prompt returns "not recognized as an internal or
  external command" the software may not be installed or configured
  properly - please consult the documentation for that software



- open emacs and type M-x shell ret
+ (Alt + x key, followed by s-h-e-l-l RETURN)
- a command prompt should open.
- at the command prompt (>) type:
